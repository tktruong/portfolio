## Bechdel Test Analysis

* Skills / Tools Used: SQL, Python, pandas, JSON

The Bechdel Test is a concise way to examine how well films represent female characters. In order to pass the test, the film needs to have:

1) At least 2 women with names
2) They talk to each other
3) They talk to each other about something other than a man

Although this is a limiting and imprecise test, it can be shocking what films pass and do not pass the Bechdel Test. For more information: https://bechdeltest.com

As part of a group project for my Python Fundamentals for Data Science course, we sought to analyze Bechdel Test rated films in conjunction with IMDB, box office, and earnings data. I was responsible for extracting the Bechdel Test data via API and cleaning it as well as filtering the large IMDB data files in SQL. I also performed analysis on Bechdel Test ratings for films over the decades and for films of the highest paid actresses of 2017 using pandas.

## Patient Query by Dx
* Skills / Tools Used: Microsoft SQL Server, Python, pandas

This is an example of the work I do as an analyst in the healthcare field. Stakeholders often request information on patients meeting certain criteria. In this case, the criteria came from a list provided by clinicians, which had to be incorporated into the SQL query.

/usr/bin/bash: q: command not found

* Skills / Tools Used: Commandline, Google BigQuery, Python, pandas, matplotlib

Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bikeshare system, which aims to be a fast, convenient way to get around--whether you're commuting, running errands, or just sightseeing. In this analysis, I utilized the pilot program data to learn which are popular commuter routes and what potential offers will increase ridership in the system. I used data from Google BigQuery stored in three tables: bikeshare_trips, bikeshare_status, and bikeshare_stations.

## Predicting Forest Cover Type using Decision Trees & Random Forest

* Skills / Tools Used: Python, pandas, numpy, sci-kit learn, matplotlib

Given only geographic and environmental variables, can we predict what type of tree grows in a 30 m x 30 m plot in a northern Colorado forest? To tackle this machine learning problem, I utilized exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and feature engineering to develop an effective Decision Tree model. Ultimately, ensemble methods such as Random Forest and "soft" voting proved to be the most accurate with this problem.

## Spark EDA Click Through Rate Data

* Skills / Tools Used: Python, Spark, pandas, seaborn

Exploratory Data Analysis on anonymized data for digital advertising. The goal of the project was to predict click through rate based on training data that consisted of numerical and categorical features. 

## Med Practice Management

* Skills / Tools Used: Python, Object-Oriented Programming

Providers such as doctors and nurses tend to utilize electronic health records systems with a practice management aspect to handle the creation of patient records, billing, and scheduling. As a healthcare analyst, I developed my own version of such a system.
