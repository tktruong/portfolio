## Bechdel Test Analysis

The Bechdel Test is a concise way to examine how well films represent female characters. In order to pass the test, the film needs to have:

1) At least 2 women with names
2) They talk to each other
3) They talk to each other about something other than a man

Although this is a limiting and imprecise test, it can be shocking what films pass and do not pass the Bechdel Test. For more information: https://bechdeltest.com

As part of a group project for my Python Fundamentals for Data Science course, we sought to analyze Bechdel Test rated films in conjunction with IMDB, box office, and earnings data. I was responsible for extracting the Bechdel Test data via API and cleaning it as well as filtering the large IMDB data files in SQL. I also performed analysis on Bechdel Test ratings for films over the decades and for films of the highest paid actresses of 2017 using pandas.
